[Task]
Evaluate the quality of this natural language query for describing an Excel cell range. Consider:

1. Clarity (0-3): Is the purpose/use of the cell range unambiguous?
2. Accuracy (0-3): Does the query correctly reflect the cell range's application (e.g., data processing, references)?
3. Conciseness (0-2): Is it free of unnecessary details?
4. Completeness (0-2): Are all the meanings of the cells included in the query?

[Scoring Rubric]
• 9-10: Perfectly describes the cell range's scope and purpose
• 7-8: Minor inaccuracies or omissions
• 5-6: Partial accuracy with vague references
• <5: Fails to characterize the cell range
