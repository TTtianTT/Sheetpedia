  "instruction": "As a data scientist, you are presented with a spreadsheet and a user query. Your task is to interpret the spreadsheet and identify the specific cell range that corresponds to the given user query. Ensure the identified range should be as precise as possible, and should not include any other irrelevant cells.",
  "spreadsheet_data_format_description": "The sheet data will be provided to you in a format as follows: Each data cell in the spreadsheet is represented by a pair consisting of the cell address and cell content, separated by a comma, such as 'A1,Year'. This means that 'A1' is the cell's address, and 'Year' is its content. Cells are separated by a vertical bar ('|'), like 'A1,Year|A2,Profit'. The cell content can be empty, resulting in cell data like 'A1,|A2,Profit'. Cells are organized in row-major order, with different rows in the spreadsheet separated by line breaks. If there are merged cells in the sheet, they are split into multiple cells and only the first cell will be filled with content, other cells will be left as blank. You can visualize the sheet data as a matrix of cells. Following the matrix, all the merged cells are provided in the format '<upper-left address>:<lower-right address>,' like 'A3:C3', with each line representing one merged cell.",
  "mandatory_rules": "Here are some mandatory instructions:\n1. Please provide the range of cells in the spreadsheet that match the given query. The answer should be in JSON format, with \"cell range\" as the key, i.e., it should be represented like ```JSON{\"cell range\": \"A1:A3\"}```.\n2. If all the extracted cells in the range for a field are consecutive, they should be represented by a merged address. For instance, consecutive cells like [\"E29\", \"E30\", \"E31\", \"E32\"] should be represented as ```JSON{\"cell range\": \"E29:E32\"}```.\n3. If the identified ranges contains some cell ranges that are consecutive, please merge them into a single range, for example, \"C4:C11,D4:D11\" should be represented as \"C4:D11\", and in case \"C9:I10,C11:I12\", they should be represented as \"C9:I12\".\n4. If there are multiple non-consecutive cell ranges, they should be represented as separate ranges within the same JSON object. For example, cells \"A1\", \"A2\", \"A3\" and \"A5\", \"A6\", \"A7\", should be represented as: ```JSON{\"cell range\": \"A1:A3,A5:A7\"}```.\n5. Please avoid adding any extra characters around this format as it will disrupt the output parsing.\n6. When generating cell ranges, it is crucial to ensure logical consistency within each column. If a series of independent data is followed by a statistical variable, such as 'total' or 'average', then when selecting data to construct the cell range, the data corresponding to 'total' or 'average' cannot be included in the result. This is because the series of independent data is homogeneous, while the 'total' or 'average' cell contains an aggregation logical above them, breaking the logical consistency. This is a rule that must be strictly adhered to. This rule is of paramount importance in data science since it ensures the accuracy and consistency of the data.\n7. If the identified ranges are \"A11:A35\" and \"C11:C35\", but the data in \"B11:B35\" is irrelevant to the query, then the correct cell range should be \"A11:A35,C11:C35\", not \"A11:C35\". This is because \"A11:C35\" would include \"B11:B35\", which is unnecessary and should not be included.\n8. When selecting cells that match the query, special attention should be given to avoid including cells that are not significantly related to the query. For example, if the query refers to data in a specific column of a table, but there are titles, notes, or other non-data elements at the top or bottom of the column, these elements should be excluded when selecting the cell range, and only the cells containing the required data should be selected. Hence, if some cells in the identified range contain titles, notes, or other non-data elements, these cells should be excluded. This is to ensure that the selected cell range accurately reflects the content of the query as much as possible, and avoids including irrelevant information, which may damage subsequent tasks.\n9. If a query pertains to the population of a specific country, the focus should be on the cells containing the actual population figures, rather than the cells containing the name of the country. This means that when selecting the cell range for data analysis, one should aim to include only cells with numerical data relevant to the query, while excluding cells with non-numeric data such as country names. This approach further refines the selection of cell ranges to ensure that only the most relevant information is included for analysis. Such experiences should be considered for similar scenarios.",
  "output_format": "Output Format: Please generate the cell range based on the user query. The output should be provided in a JSON format, enclosed in ```Json and ``` markdown code blocks, with a key of 'cell range' and the generated cell range as the corresponding value.",
